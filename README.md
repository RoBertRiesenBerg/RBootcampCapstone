# R Bootcamp Capstone

This repository is used to track the code used pricing challenge in the R Bootcamp course with the CAS. Down the road, will look to add and complete the Reserving project as well.

Final code used in the Pricing project can be found in the `Capstone.Rmd` file.

Please feel free to create pull requests and contribute to the code.
